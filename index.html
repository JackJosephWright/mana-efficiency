            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the Limited format of Magic: The Gathering, there is a notable correlation between mana efficiency (spending the most possible mana on any given turn) and winning. At a high level, we observe a linear correlation between win rate and mana differential over 4.7 million games.</p>

            <h2>Graph Analysis</h2>
            <p>The following graph illustrates the mean win rate of games with the corresponding mana difference. Although the relationship is not strictly linear, the degree of structure in this data is surprising. Modeling the linear range of this data returns an R-squared value of 0.99. This analysis even excludes the final turn of the game to account for the advantage of the first player getting an extra turn to spend mana.</p>

            <h2>High-Level Players Spend More Mana</h2>
            <p>To investigate the relationship between player rank and mana efficiency, I analyzed the average mana spent by rank on MTG Arena, adjusting for game length and mana curve. The plot below illustrates a clear trend: as player rank increases, so does the average mana spent per turn. This linear increase is consistent across every rank except the lowest rank, likely due to 17lands users starting new accounts. By controlling for curve and game length, it is evident that higher-level players optimize their card sequencing for mana efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Outcomes by Turn and Efficiency</h2>
            <p>This plot provides a detailed view of mana efficiency over turns in Magic: The Gathering, illustrating how variability in mana usage correlates with win rates.</p>
            <p>The central line graph illustrates the average mana spent per turn, establishing a baseline measure of efficiency across different phases of the game. The shaded regions around this line indicate the win rate corresponding to the mana spent. The mean mana spent aligns with the average 17Lands win rate of 55%. Deviations from this mean show a consistent pattern: as the distance from the mean increases, the win rate either rises or falls accordingly.</p>

            <h2>Strategic Insights</h2>
            <p>The primary strategic insight from these plots is the bias towards mana efficiency: games where players spend more mana on average per turn tend to have higher win rates, while lower mana expenditure correlates with decreased win rates. Higher-level players consistently spend more mana than their lower-level counterparts, as confirmed by the turn-by-turn mana analysis. Optimizing mana usage each turn is crucial for enhancing strategic play and increasing the chances of winning.</p>
